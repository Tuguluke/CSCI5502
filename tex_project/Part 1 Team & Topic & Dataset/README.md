Part 1 .
Team & Topic & Dataset
One of the most important parts to this project is to make sure you have a dataset. While there
are many very interesting questions you could ask, if you cannot access any data to mine for
those answers then you will not be able to use those questions for your project! Make sure you
come up with your interesting questions along with ensuring you have access to a dataset that
can answer your question. Download the dataset to be sure, this has been a problem in the past!
Size of data set - hopefully millions of data points. A few thousand is too small.
But always start by testing with a small data set to test and get going (medium-sized sample) so
you can see the results within half an hour. Make sure getting code correct before testing takes a
long time.
For Part 1 you will create a set of slides that you will present in class and that will be saved as
a .PDF for the Part 1 submission with the following information (be brief):
● Title: Descriptive title of your project
● Team members: first and last name of each member
● Description: 2-3 sentence paragraph project description - what interesting questions do
you intend to answer?
● Prior Work: What prior work has been done on your idea
● Datasets:
○ List of datasets to use
○ Where found (URL and who is supplying the data, e.g., NASA)
○ Whether it you have it downloaded (on who’s machine)
● Proposed work: what do you need to do?
○ Data cleaning:
○ Data preprocessing:
○ Data integration:
○ etc.
● List of tool(s) you intend to use
● Evaluation: How you can evaluate your results
Note: There are no right or wrong questions, only interesting questions.
Submission Requirements:
● Create a group github account.
● Get everyone in the group set up as a contributor.
● Submit to your group github account a PDF named Group#\_ProjectTitle_Part1.PDF
(E.g., 03_MiningForGoldInStocks_Part1.PDF). Do not put this in any subdirectory.
