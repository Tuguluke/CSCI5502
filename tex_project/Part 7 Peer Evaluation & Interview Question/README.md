Part 7 .
Peer Evaluation & Interview Question
Each person individually fills out the peer evaluation form (see Moodle) and submits into Moodle
as an Excel spreadsheet (do not convert to .PDF). This will be incorporated into the individual
project grade for groups that have someone not helping much at all or someone who put
considerable extra effort helping others and/or developing the project as a good team player.
However, taking over the project and not being a good/helpful team player is bad!
Please note: Giving everyone the same number does not count as filling out this form!
You will need to fill in the comments to support your evaluation, as well as answer the Team
Dynamics question. For Team Dynamics, enter the letter a, b, or c for “Which one” to
specify which question you are answering.
Submit to Moodle as:
Group#\_YourLastName_YourFirstName_PeerEval.xls e.g., 03_Boese_Elle_PeerEval.xls
