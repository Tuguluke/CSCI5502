\section{ Problem Statement/motivation}
 (like homework 1, what knowledge and how would you apply that knowledge, what is interesting that you hope to find)
\section{Literature survey }
(previous work) describe and cite.
\section{Proposed Work }
 E.g., what do you need to do for data collection, preprocessing (cleaning  integrating, transforming, etc.), process for derived data, design, evaluation. Describe how it is different than what has been done previously from your literature survey (or if replicating).
\section{Data set }
(make sure you have the data set!). Provide URL and details about the data set (similar to homework 1, chapter 2, etc.)
\section{ Evaluation Methods }
E.g., metrics, existing solutions, â€¦
\section{Tools}
\section{Milestones}
What you plan to have done by when\\
The Following table is my work plan for carrying out the project.
